Ι Γ HE text of this epistle is given from
' ’ Dr. Bmmv's edition, except in some
few places, of which the render is advertised in
the notes. . These, that they might not break in
⁷too much on the thread os the Commentary, are
here printed by themselves. For the rest, let me
ppoiogize with a great eritic; Nobis viri dom·
ignoscent, fihaecsuſsus: praesertim β cogitent, vm*
‘critici fii, non literulam alibi ejicere, alibi innocen.
