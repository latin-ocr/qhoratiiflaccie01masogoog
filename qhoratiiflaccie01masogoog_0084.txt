οἱ the second, concerning the abuse rs words. For,
ι. the style of the drama representing real lise,
and demanding‚ on that account, apeculiar ease

and familiarity in the language, the prastice of
coining new words must be more insufferahle iu
this, than in any other species of poetry.· The
majesty of the epic will even sometimes require
tohe supported by this means, when the ›com-
monost ear would resent it, as downright affec·
ration upon the stage. Hence the peculiar pro·
Ι priety os this rule to the dratnatic writer,

α’. Next, it is necessary to keep the tragic style,
though condescending, in some sort, to the sa-
miliar cast os conversation, from striking heneath
the dignity of the personages‚ and the solemnity
osthe representation. Now no expedient can
more happisy effe& this, than what the po'et' prg-
scribes concerning the pr nien and derivative o'f
words. For thus, the language‚ without incui-
ring the odium os absolutely invented tenus,
sustains itself in a bepcorning stateliness and re· ³
serve, and, whilst it seems to stoop to the leves
of conversation, artsulsy eludes the meanness of
etrite, p1·osaic'styse.7·-There are wonderfuiin·
