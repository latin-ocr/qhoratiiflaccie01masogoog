tentureto say, the faculties os the writer, the ’

charnis of poetry, or even the thought of irnita-
tion‚ never corne into the spediator’s head. But
he may feel the effe& of thern, it will be said,

deferres no further notice. As to the dffcusry‘

ridrnirted

2.The representation, however distrefuful, re· ,

still seen to be 1 representation. We find our
1111111 affected, and even paiued, , by a good
H 2 tragedy.
