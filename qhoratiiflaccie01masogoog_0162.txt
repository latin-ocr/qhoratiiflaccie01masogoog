suited to the wildness of Ovid's genius, and
which, us appears from‘his relation 'of this story.
in the Metanuorphofis, he knew not how ιο trent
without running into some excess and luxuriance
in that part. But, whether this were the cause or
no, the very treating a subject, which had gone
through such hunde, as Euripiden, Ennius, and
Ovid, war enough to expose a writer of better
judgment, than seneen, to some hazrrd. For,
in attempting to outdo originale, founded on rhe'
plan of simple nature, ,awriter is in the utmost
danger of running into affedhation and bomhast.

And indeed, without this temptation, our writere' ἶ
have generally found meane to incur these1
exceffes; the very best of them being too apt,⁵ ¹

to 'fill their plohs with unnatural incidente, and
to heighten their charadrers into caricatures.

Though it may be doubted; whether this hath ‘
been owing so much to their oren ill teste, ns ιο
