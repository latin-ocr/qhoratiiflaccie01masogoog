What harh 'chiefly missed the critice in their

explanation os this place, l suspect to have been

the frequent encomiumo on the severity of the
sancient mesre, -by the Greek and Latin writers.

Thoogh here they, seem to have overlooked two
very material consrderatione: 1. That thesormer
have chiefly treated the subjectio a moral or-

public manners. For this reason Plato, one of

the pradice of AEgypt‚ in suffering no. change
of her poetry, but continuing, to his time, her
fondness lor the Songs of Ifis [De Leg. 1. ilesob
