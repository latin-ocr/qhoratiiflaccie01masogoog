ΑΗ OPPOETRY. 181

kept hirn at a gleater distance from the schools, ’

had yet his share os this philosophical humour.
Now this apology for the praelice of the Greek
poete doth by no means extend to the Roman; ·
philosophy having been very late, and never ge-
nerally, the taste of Rome. ·

Cicero says, Philosophia quidm lantum abest ut
proinde, ac da hominum est vitei merila, laudetur, lat
a· plerisque mgledla, o multis etiamsoivupernor. ln
another place he tells vs, thatin his time Aris-¹

hone waa notmach known, or read, even by the ¹

philosophers themselves. [Cic. v‘op. stab iae]
And, though in the age of Seneca, sentences,-

we kaow„were naueh in use, yet the cast and·

turn of them evidently lhevv them to have been,

the affedlationf o the lettered fiw, and not the ,

general mode and prasiiee of the tvme. For the
quaintness, in which Seneea'h aphorisma are

dressed, manifestly speaks the labour and artifice
of the closet, and vs just the reverse of that easy,

simple expreffion, which clothes them intthe
Greek poete, thus demonstrating their familiar ’

curreney in common life. Under any other ι

circumstances than these, the pradiee, as was
observed, ,must be unquellionably faulty · except

only ιιι the chorus, where, sor the reason before .

given, it may always, with good advantage, be
employed..
