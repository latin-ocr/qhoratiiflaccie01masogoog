what Qrinslilian, in his account of it, expressly

observes of the old cornedy, Nescio an ulla poeste “ ’

(post Homerum) aut tmilior iteratoribus, autad
oratores faciendos aptior. The reason, doubtless,
was, that strength, and prompt and eloquent free-
dom, Vires et sarunalfflma libertas, which hc had
before observed, so peculiarly belonged to it.

And this, I think will go some way towards
clearing an embarraffing circumstance tn the
history os the Roman learning, which I know
not is any writer hath yet taken notice of. lt
is, that thoug hMenander and the 'authors os the

new comedy were afterwards admired, as the
only masters o sthe comic drama, yet this does

¹ not appear tohave been seen, or, at least, so sully
‘aeknowledged by the Roman writers, till aster

¹the Augustanage3 notwithstanding that the Ro· ‘

nran taste was, from that time, vifibly declihiug.
The reason, [doubt not, was, that the popular
eloquence, which continued, in a good degree
os vigour, to that time, participating more os
the freedom of the old cornic beuter, and rejec-
ting, as impropcr to its end, the refinements of
¹‚tlte new, insensrbly depraued the public taste;
which, by degrees only, arid not till astudied
and cautious declamation had, by the necessary
influence os absolute power, succeeded to the li·
berty os their old oratory, was sully reconciled -
to the delicacy and stridl decorum os Menander's

wit.
